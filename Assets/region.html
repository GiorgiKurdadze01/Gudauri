                    <h3>and Gudauri started just like this...</h3>
                    <span>Gudauri will probably slowly come to the attention of Europeans. We are talking about
                        mountain-ski sports specialists, otherwise Gudauri has already attracted the attention of
                        Europeans in the last century. Alexandre Dumas wrote in his "Caucasus": "There is no place on
                        the entire military road of Georgia more fascinating with its beauty and variety of impressions
                        than the descent from Gudauri to Mleti through</span>

                    <img src="/Assets/Picture/ad-2.webp" alt="">

                <div class="full-width-history">
                    <span>the Upper Mleti Valley. The snowy peaks of the Caucasus seem to be pulled directly behind your
                        shoulders and feel so close and obvious that you want to touch them with your hands. The sun is
                        also closely covering the mountains, so closely that you think you can reach it by raising your
                        hand." With this quote from Dumas, Otar Cherkezia, the deputy chairman of the Council of
                        Ministers of the Georgian SSR, opened the first official competition held in Gudauri: "Gudauri
                        Spring" - as the chairman of the competition's organizing committee. The report on the first
                        competition held in Gudauri was printed in the historical Georgian sports newspaper "Lelo".
                        According to the report, the competition took place on March 24-25, 1984. </span>

                    <span>
                        The program included two types of mountain-ski sports - special slalom and giant slalom. In
                        addition to the main competitions, the junior competition was also held in 1968. In addition,
                        demonstration performances in sports acrobatics were organized and students of the Republican
                        Mountain-Skiing School showed their skills. More than four decades have passed since then, and
                        today all this is already history...

                        A few years before the competition, Italian experts studied the potential of winter resorts in
                        Gudauri and upon returning to Samshbol, published a report containing the phrase: "For the
                        development of mountain-ski sports and mountain tourism, there is no other place for us than
                        Gurdauri."

                        Many years later, Vakhtang Mikeladze, the experienced manager and architect of the "Gudauri"
                        hotel, and as the first discoverer of Gudauri's mountain-resort potential, Mariam Vardoshvili,
                        says in an interview: "That's when the planning of Gudauri really began... but the start of
                        construction was possible only with the energy and persistence of Soliko Khabeishvili. . It was
                        very difficult to convince him that something should be built in Gudauri, but when he believed,
                        nothing could stand in his way. At first, we brought one cable car to Gudauri and installed it,
                        several cottages were built. Before that, there was a hotel "Bidara", which was at the foot of
                        the pass in terrible climatic conditions, but somehow it was renovated. We brought the children
                        there and settled them. It was a pain to go to Gudauri from there, it is only five kilometers,
                        but it was difficult to walk this road in the cold and frost, but we started anyway"...

                        "Comrade Eduard Shevardnadze visited Gudauri again on Sunday together with other comrades.
                        Today, Gudauri enthusiasts need their support and encouragement like air, who spare no effort
                        and energy to implement the resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Georgian SSR of
                        September 1982 "On the creation of a winter sports and recreation area in Gudauri".
